Sign Language Convert into Text And Speech
ntroduction
This project focuses on translating sign language gestures into text and speech using computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing. It aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals by providing real-time gesture interpretation.

Features
Real-time hand gesture detection using a camera.
Conversion of gestures into text using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Text-to-speech functionality for audio output.
Easy-to-use web interface developed with Flask.
NLP-based query matching using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
First aid advice integration for natural disaster scenarios.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe
Flask
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
UNet (for segmentation)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Text-to-speech library
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-to-text-and-speech.git  ](https://github.com/Sharath12357/sign-language-convert-int-text-and-speech/)
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd sign-language-to-text-and-speech  
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Flask application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py  
How It Works
Gesture Detection: Hand gestures are detected using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
Gesture Classification: A CNN model classifies the gestures.
Text Conversion: The recognized gesture is converted into text.
Speech Conversion: The text is converted to speech using a text-to-speech library.
First Aid Assistance: User queries are matched with a first aid database to provide relevant advice.
Demo
Include screenshots or a link to a demo video showcasing the project.

Future Enhancements
Extend gesture recognition to additional sign languages.
Improve accuracy by incorporating more advanced models.
Add support for multiple languages in text-to-speech.
